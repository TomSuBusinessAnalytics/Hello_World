Hi!
I'm Tom Su, a Junior in the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa and going to major in accounting and business analytics. I have great interest in accounting and business analytics, which keeps giving me passions to soldier on in these fields. Also, I am an international student from southern China, and I have plenty experience in both in American and Chinese culture, which makes me an idea person in an organization that involve in international business. Staying competitive and creative always empowers me in work.
